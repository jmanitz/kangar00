# Introduction

Testing of biological meaningful SNP Sets is a successful strategy for the 
evaluation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Via mapping of SNPs to 
genes forming a network, associations of specific pathways with disease risks 
can be evaluated.  
Kernel methods are particularly well suited to cope with the challenges connected 
to the analysis of large SNP sets from GWAS data. 
Logistic kernel machine regression can model the effect of a pathway on binary 
outcome non-parametrically, including parametrically modelled covariates. The 
model is given by

$$logit(P(y_i=1|x_i,z_i))=x_i^t \beta + h(z_i)       (1)        $$                        		

where $y_i$ denotes the case or control status of individual i, $x_i$ is 
the vector including informative covariates (such as age, sex, etc.) and $z_i$ 
represents the genotypes of individual i. $\beta$ is the regression coefficients 
for the parametric part of the model, while $h(.)$ denotes an unknown function, 
non-parametrically incorporating the pathway's influence. The intercept is 
assumed to be included in $x_i$. For more details see Liu et al (2008).

Different kernels have been proposed that convert the genomic information of two
 individuals into a quantitative value reflecting their genetic similarity. 
This package includes the linear kernel as well as two more advanced kernels, 
adjusting for size bias in the number of SNPs and genes in a pathway or 
incorporating the network structure of genes within the pathway, respectively. 
The kernel functions are described in more detail in the instructions below.
 
A variance component test constructed around the similarity matrix can be used 
to evaluate a pathway's influence on disease risk. In `kangar00` p-values can be
 calculated with the Satterthwaite approximation or Davies method as described 
 in Schaid (2010) and Davies (1980), respectively.


# Data extraction and preparation


## Pathways

The kangar00 package offers several functions for data extraction from internet 
databases. In the following they will be explained using the Circadian rhythm 
pathway as an example.

*   In the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al 2014) this pathway is identified with 
    the id *hsa04710*. 

*   The function `pathway_info()` can use this id to create a table listing all 
    genes included in Circadian rhythm. For each gene the startpoint, endpoint 
    and the chromosome are listed.
     
*  Gene membership is obtained directly from KEGG, while startpoints, endpoints 
   and chromosome information is extracted from Ensemble (Cunningham et al 2015).
   The database is accessed via the function `getBM()` in the biomaRt package. 
   This means that the gene boundaries given will equal the current build used 
   in Ensemble. An internet connection is required for this step.   
``` 
pathway_info('hsa04710')   
```
will return a data frame looking like 
    
| pathway | gene_start| gene_end |chr|  gene |
|:-------:|----------:|---------:|--:|:-----:|
|hsa04710 | 13276652  | 13387266 | 11|ARNTL  |
|hsa04710 | 4979116   | 4985323  |  3|BHLHE40|
|hsa04710 | 26120026  | 26125127 | 12|BHLHE41| 
|hsa04710 |   ...     |    ...   | ...| ...  |

listing informatin on all genes KEGG assigns to Circadian rhythm.



### Networkmatrix

The gene-gene interactions within pathways are represented by a network matrix. 
This quadratic matrix is of dimension equal to the number of genes in 
the corresponding pathway. It includes entries equal to $1$ (representing an 
activation interaction), $-1$ (denoting an inhibiting interaction) or $0$ 
(no interaction). Every gene is modeled as self-interacting, thus all diagonal
elements are $1$. 

A networkmatrix can be created using the function `get_network_matrix()`. Gene
interaction information for a specific pathway is extracted from the KEGG
database. It is accessed via the function `retrieveKGML()` from the `KEGGgraph`
 package. An internet connection is required for this step. 

``` 
get_network_matrix('hsa04710', directed=FALSE)
``` 
will download the KEGG XML file for the pathway with ID 'hsa04710' and save 
it in the working directory. The function will convert the data into a
networkmatrix and return it. The user can specify whether this `matrix` should
be given directed (directed=TRUE) or undirected (directed=FALSE).

### Pathway object

In `kangar00` all information on a specific pathway is combined in a `pathway`
object.  It includes 

*   The pathway's ID as used in KEGG. 

*   The adjacency `matrix`, which equals the network matrix without signs. 

*   A `vector` giving the signs for the interactions.

``` 
N <- get_network_matrix('hsa04710', directed=FALSE)
p <- pathway(id='hsa04710', adj=abs(N), sign=as.vector(N[N!=0]))
``` 

## SNP positions

Kangar00 offers a function to update the positions of the SNPs in your GWAS 
dataset.
 
*  `snp_info()` will take a vector of rsnumbers and give the corresponding base 
   pair positions.
   
*  Positions are extracted from the Ensemble database and thus equal the current 
   build used on the website. The database is accessed via the function `getBM()` 
   from the package `biomaRt`. This requires an internet connection. 

``` 
snp_info("rs234")  
```
will return the data frame 

| chr |  position |rsnumber|
|:---:|:---------:|:------:|
| 7   | 105920689 | rs234  |


## Pathway Annotation

To define SNP sets representing a pathway, the function `get_anno()` can be used. 

*   Input arguments equal the data frames produces by the two above functions 
   `pathway_info()` and `snp_info()`. 

*  If you do not want to update your SNP information, you have to create a data 
   frame listing all SNPs to be annotated. This data frame must include the columns
   'chr', 'position' and 'rsnumber', giving for each SNP the chromosome it lies on, 
   its base pair position on the chromosome and the rsnumber identifier, respectively.
   See also the output description of `snp_info()`.

*  For annotation the package `sqldf` is used.

```
get_anno(snp_info, pathway_info)
```
will return a data frame listing all SNPs that lie inside the boundaries of one 
or more genes in the pathway. That means that genes can appear several times, 
depending on the number of SNPs mapped to them. A SNP can and will be mapped to 
multiple genes if they overlap. The data frame will have the following format

| pathway | gene| chr  |    snp    | position|
|:-------:|----:|-----:|----------:|--------:|
|hsa04710 | CSNK1E| 22 | rs11089885|38413480 |
|hsa04710 | CSNK1E| 22 | rs13054361|38336819 |
|hsa04710 | CSNK1E| 22 | rs135757  |38307648 | 
|hsa04710 |   ... | ...|   ...     |  ...    |


## GWAS data

Data from a case control study is needed to test a pathways influence on disease
 risk with the logistic kernel machine test. In `kangar00` GWAS study data is 
 represented by the `GWASdata` object. It includes 
 
*   Genotype data for each individual. 
 
       *  Genotype data needs to be one line per individual and in `ffdf` format,         
          which is a data frame as specified within the `ff` package. 
       *  Columnames give ID numbers for the individuals while rownames give the
          rsnumbers corresponding to the SNPs genotyped in the study.          
       *  Note that missing values are not allowed and SNPs with missing genotypes
          have to be imputed or excluded from the sample prior to creation of the
         `GWASdata` object. 
        
*   Phenotype data for each individual.

       *  Phenotypes need to be given in a `data frame` with the first column 
          including the individual IDs as in the genotype sample.       
       *  Further columns can contain informative covariates (such as age, sex,
          ...) to be used in the logistic regression model.  
         
*   Annotation of study SNPs to pathways created by `get_anno`. 
 
       *  This `data frame` defines the SNP set representing a specific pathway.
          It is created using the function `get_anno()` and added as an attribute 
          to the genotype containing object.
       
*   A `character` describing the data is added to the `GWASdata` object. This 
    could for instance be the name of the study.    

A `GWASdata` object can be constructed as 
```
anno  <- get_anno(snp_info, pathway_info)                   
pheno <- read.table("...path/to/file/containing/phenotypes")
geno  <- read.table("...path/to/file/containing/genotypes")          
geno  <- as.ffdf(geno)                    
attr(geno,"anno") <- anno

my_gwas <- GWASdata(pheno=pheno, geno=geno, desc="study xy")
```


# Calculation of Kernelmatrices

Once a `GWASdata` object is created, we can start to calculate kernelmatrices to
test for a pathways influence on disease risk. `Kangar00` offers three different
kernel functions to compute a similarity matrix for the individuals in analysis. 
They will be explained in the following.


## Linear Kernel (Lin) 

The linear kernel assumes additive SNP effects. It is calculated as 
$$ZZ^t         (2)$$ 
where $Z$ denotes the genotype matrix (See also Liu et al, 2010). 
In `kangar00` a linear kernel can be created using the function `kernel_lin()`. 
It requires as arguments 

*   A `GWASdata` object containing the genotype information.

*   A `pathway` object specifying the pathway to be tested. 

*   A value for argument `parallel` to decide how the kernel should be 
    calculated. Currently `none` for sequential, `cpu` for parallel and `gpu`
    for gpu calculation are available.  
 
```
K_lin <- kernel_lin(gwas, p, parallel='none')
```

will return a quadratic `matrix` of dimension equal to the number of individuals
in the `GWASdata` object.


## Size-adjusted Kernel (Sia) 

The size-adjusted kernel takes into consideration the numbers of SNPs and genes 
in a pathway to correct for size bias. It is calculated as 
$$ K_{i,j} = exp( - \sqrt{ \frac{1}{r_p} } \sum_{g } ( \frac{|| z_i^g - z_j^g||}
   { \mu_g k_g^{eff}})^{\delta}_g )           (3)$$ 

Here $z_i^g$ is the vector of individual i 's genotypes in gene $g$ and $r_p$ the
number of genes in pathway $p$. Scaling parameters $k_g^{eff}$, $\mu^g$ and 
$\delta_g$ adjust for the number of genes in the pathway and the number of SNPs 
within these genes (for more details refer to Freytag et al. 2012).

A kernel of this type can be calculated using the function `kernel_sia()` with  
the following arguments 

*   A `GWASdata` object containing the genotype information.

*   A `pathway` object specifying the pathway to be tested. 

*   A value for argument `parallel` to decide how the kernel should be 
    calculated. Currently `none` for sequential, `cpu` for parallel and `gpu`
    for gpu calculation are available.  
 
```
K_sia <- kernel_sia(gwas, p, parallel='gpu')
```
will return a quadratic `matrix` of dimension equal to the number of individuals
in the `GWASdata` object.


## Network Kernel (Net) 

The network kernel incorporates information about gene-gene interactions into 
the model. It is defined as 
$$ K = Z A N A^t Z^t      (4)$$  
where matrix $A$ maps SNPs to genes, $N$ represents the underlying network 
structure, and $Z$ is the genotype matrix. 
The network based kernelmatrix for a pathway can be calculated with the function
 `kernel_net()`. Following arguments are needed 

*   A `GWASdata` object containing the genotype information.

*   A `pathway` object specifying the pathway to be tested. 

*   A value for argument parallel to decide how the kernel should be 
    calculated. Currently 'none' for sequential, 'cpu' for parallel and 'gpu'
    for gpu calculation are available.  
 
```
K_net <- kernel_net(gwas, p, parallel='none')
```
will return a quadratic `matrix` of dimension equal to the number of individuals
in the `GWASdata` object.


# Variance Component Test

A pathways influence on the probability of being a case is evaluated in a 
variance component test. The test statistic is
$$ Q = \frac{1}{2} ( y - \mu)^t K ( y - \mu)  (5)$$
with $\mu$ the vector of nullmodel estimators given by $\mu_i = logit^{-1} 
(x_i^t \beta)$ for an individual $i$ and $K$ a kernelmatrix of the pathway to be
 tested. $Q$ follows a mixture of $X^2$ distributions which 
 can be approximated using the Satterthwaite procedure (Schaid 2012) or
 Davies method as implemented in the R package `QuadCompForm` (Davies 1980). 
  More details on the test can be found in Wu et al (2010). 
 
In `kangar00` the logistic kernel machine test can be applied to a SNP set 
defining a pathway with the function `lkmt`. It needs the following arguments

*    A formular specifying the nullmodel to be used in the test. The dependent 
     variable is the case control status of the individual (in the example 
     denoted as 'pheno') and is explained by an intercept and optional 
     covariates. 
     
*    A linear, size-adjusted or network kernelmatrix calculated by one of the
     kernelfunctions `kernel_lin()`, `kernel_sia()` or `kernel_net()`. 

*    A  `GWASdata` object including the genotype based on which the test
     should be performed.
     
*    A `character` specifying which method should be used to calculate the 
     p-value. Available are 'satt' for the Satterthwaite approximation (Schaid
     2010) or 'davies' for Davies method (Davies 1980). 
     
```
pval_net <- lkmt(pheno ~ 1+sex+age, K_mat, my_gwas, method='satt')
```
will return an object of type `lkmt` giving the test result for the pathway 
on which the kernelmatrix 'K_mat' was calculated. The `GWASdata` object 
'my_gwas' has to be the same as used to calculate the kernelmatrix. 
 The formular above would for example fit for a phenotype file of the
 following format (IDs in first column are always required in phenotype file)

|  ID |pheno|sex|age|smoker| 
|:---:|:---:|:-:|:-:|:----:|
| ind1|  1  | 1 | 41|  1   |
| ind2|  0  | 0 | 38|  0   |
| ind3|  1  | 1 | 56|  1   |
| ... | ... |...|...| ...  |

note, that the columns to be used in the model are specified in the formular
given to the `lkmt()` function and not all covariates have to be used.
