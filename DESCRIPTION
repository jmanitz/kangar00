Description: This package includes methods to extract information on pathways, genes and SNPs from online databases and to evaluate these data using the logistic kernel machine test (LKMT) with three different kernel functions. In the LKMT, we employed the linear kernel as well as two more advanced kernels, adjusting for size bias in the number of SNPs and genes in a pathway or incorporating the network structure of genes within the pathway, respectively.
